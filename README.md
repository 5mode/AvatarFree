# Avatar Free
Let everyone have its social presence.<br>

Hello and welcome to Avatar Free!<br>
	  
Avatar Free is a light, simple, software on premise to build your social presence.<br>
	   
Avatar Free is released under GPLv3 license, it is supplied AS-IS and we do not take any responsibility for its misusage.<br>
	   
First step, use the password box and salt fields to create the hash to insert in the config file. Remember to manually set there also the salt value.<br>
	   
As you are going to run Avatar Free in the PHP process context, using a limited web server or phpfpm user, you must follow some simple directives for an optimal first setup:<br>

<ol>
<li>Check the write permissions of your "data" folder in your web app Private path; and set its path in the config file.</li>
<li>Set the default Locale.</li>
<li>Set IMAGE_MAX_SIZE and DOC_MAX_SIZE (remember that some PHP settings could limit the upload behaviour of Avatar free</li>
</ol> 

<br>
